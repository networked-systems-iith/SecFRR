**Section 1: FRR Systems Blink and RouteScout - Add Feature Extraction Plugin**

This README provides instructions for integrating a feature extraction plugin into FRR Systems' Blink and RouteScout. To enhance the functionality of FRR Systems' Blink and RouteScout, you can integrate a feature extraction plugin. This plugin facilitates the extraction of specific features from data packets or network traffic.


**Section 2: Demonstrate Attacks**

This section focuses on demonstrating various types of attacks on Blink and RouteScout.

**Section 3: Chi-Squared Test**

**Introduction:**
The Chi-Squared Test is a statistical method used to determine the association between categorical variables and assess whether the observed distribution differs significantly from the expected distribution.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Observed Frequencies:** The actual counts or frequencies observed for each category in the dataset.
- **Expected Frequencies:** The counts or frequencies that would be expected under the null hypothesis of independence between variables.
- **Degrees of Freedom:** The number of independent categories minus one.
- **Chi-Squared Statistic:** A measure of the discrepancy between observed and expected frequencies, calculated as the sum of squared differences divided by the expected frequencies.
- **Critical Value:** The threshold value used to determine statistical significance, based on the chosen significance level and degrees of freedom.

**Procedure:**
1. **Formulate Hypotheses:** Define the null hypothesis (H0) stating independence between variables and the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggesting dependence.
2. **Calculate Expected Frequencies:** Compute the expected frequencies for each category based on the total sample size and marginal probabilities.
3. **Compute Chi-Squared Statistic:** Calculate the Chi-Squared statistic using the formula and the observed and expected frequencies.
4. **Determine Significance:** Compare the computed Chi-Squared value with the critical value from the Chi-Squared distribution table to determine statistical significance.
5. **Interpret Results:** If the computed Chi-Squared value exceeds the critical value, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant association between variables.
